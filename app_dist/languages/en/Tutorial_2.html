<p class='p-static'>Breathing <p>
<p class='p-static'>Always breathe through your nose. Take long, slow, lazy inhales. Fill yourself with air starting from your lower belly up to the top of your lungs. Let the belly go up with the inhale and go down with the exhale.<p>
<p class='p-static'>Your exhale should be free â€“ let the air flow away freely without pushing or slowing it down. Allow your body and gravity to do the work.<p>
<p class='p-static'>Six breaths per minute is the most optimal breathing pattern but if it feels like it is too slow or too fast for you, you can choose 5 or 7 breaths per minute. <p>
