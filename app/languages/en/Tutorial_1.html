    <p class='p-static'>You should maintain a relaxed body position during app usage. You may choose to lay down or to
        sit comfortably. Accept your thoughts and feelings as they are. Let your thoughts and feelings pass and go
        without evaluation, just flowing like clouds in the sky without attaching to them or pushing them away.
